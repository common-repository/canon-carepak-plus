##overview	
Canon CarePAK PLUS AND CarePAK PRO offers protection from accidental damage such as drops, spills, power surges, and more, including normal wear and tear, beyond the standard warranty period. With a CarePAK, a damaged product will be repaired to good working condition or replaced with an equivalent product.
CarePAK is cost-effective and easy-to-use, providing additional years of service and support from the date the Canon product is purchased. Your customers will enjoy peace of mind for years to come knowing their new equipment is covered.
Canon CarePAK is powered by QuickCover®, a platform developed by After Inc., the leader in post-sale customer experience technology. Canon CarePAK and QuickCover® technology were created to enable merchants to offer service plans for a wide variety of Canon products including cameras, lenses, printers, camcorders, binoculars, and more.
